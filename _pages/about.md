Welcome to my corner of the web! I'm **Rosemary Koikara**, a Software Engineer who's obsessed with all things AI, blockchain, and cryptography. Over the past 5 years, I've been knee-deep in backend development, building everything from distributed cryptographic protocols to GPU-optimized solutions.

My journey into the world of technology started with a simple curiosity - how does this thing work? That curiosity quickly spiraled into a full-blown fascination with cryptography and the thrill of implementing complex protocols. Fun fact: I wrote my first significant program in BASIC at age 10 to manage my home library that consisted of 20 books (chuckles). Fast forward to today, and I've picked up a few more tricks along the way, including C++, Python, Rust and Solidity. With a solid grounding in theoretical cryptography and hands-on experience in deep learning, I love tackling challenges around performance, scalability, and security from unique angles.

These days, I'm leading AI projects that are making a real difference -think smarter traffic systems in the bustling hubs of Seoul, South Korea. One of the highlights of my career so far? Presenting our "Smart School Safety Management System" at the UN Public Forum Awards Ceremony exhibition. I'm all about solving tough problems and seeing the impact of our work in the real world.

But let's be real - coding isn't just about the lines of code. It's about the people you work with and the ideas you bring to life together. I'm a firm believer that the best solutions come from diverse teams bouncing ideas off each other, And I'm always eager to learn from and contribute to the community. When I'm not buried in code, you'll find me geeking out over new tech, sharing thoughts on my blog, or diving into one of my many non-tech hobbies.

Join me as I delve into the latest in GPU optimization, AI, blockchain and cryptography. Together, we can explore the fascinating world of technology and how it's shaping the future.
